                Imagine being a SaaS founder in 2020, thinking you had time. Then LLMs showed up and laughed. The entry barrier to build a SaaS is trending towards 0 and very few software companies will manage to keep a real moat on a tech that's evolving this fast. It's all gonna polarize & only low IQ software and super techy labs will survive. The middle ground will likely die (aka 98% of current B2B SaaS).

                  Unless you are an absolute DL wizz (trust us, we&apos;re not), we think it&apos;s too risky to play on the right side of the curve. We believe there&apos;s a multi billion-dollar opportunity by building a cash-machine system exactly like Rocket Internet, Voodoo &amp; Bending Spoons have done for the past 20 years, mixing the best of those 3 models. If you build something today AI will likely commoditize it or make it irrelevant within a few years. For example &gt; why would a company pay for a specific productivity tool when in a few years AI could generate an equivalent app or feature on-demand? (Aside friction from data transitioning).

                    Yes, products like Notion / Figma / Slack have built defensibility through brand affinity & network effects but they're the exceptions, not the rule. Very few companies can scale fast enough to reach this kind of moat before AI makes them obsolete.

                  Sure there&apos;ll be a bit of lag before we hit the &quot;prompt2saas&quot; inflexion pointâ€¦ but it will happen anyway. The beauty of low tech B2C products is in its irrationality and its ability to better withstand the paradigm shift we&apos;re entering. It&apos;s way simpler to sell an emotion than a technical solution where the best engineers on the planet are all competing. <span className="text-black/40 font-bold">Emotions don&apos;t get disrupted</span>. B2C products are emotion-driven, irrational and resilient in a way.

                  Universal Pictures didn't make every blockbuster in-house &gt; they created a system, recruited top directors, writers and actors &amp; ensured that once a movie hit the box office everything downstream was optimized: marketing / distribution / merchandising... Studios had one job: turn creative potential into predictable profit.

                  The genius of Voodoo &amp; Rocket Internet wasn't in making original products &gt; it was in <span className="text-black/40 font-bold">industrializing the creative process</span>. They didn't guess what would work, they built feedback loops to systematically test and double down. What we're building here is an industrial cashflow factory where software products are assembly-line tested. We iterate like mad, and when something clicks we scale. Don't be afraid to rip off existing models and straight-up clone them with better execution.

                  Once we crash-test and validate the framework on 3-4 successful ideas, the real fun begins. Our goal is to onboard the scrappiest independent teams into our GTM machine, take a cut while retaining operational roles to maintain quality & scale execution.
